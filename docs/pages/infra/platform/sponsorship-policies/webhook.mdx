# How to use Sponsorship Policy webhook

Webhook allows you to receive real-time notifications when a sponsorship policy is triggered. You can use webhooks to approve or reject sponsoring userops. Start by going to the [sponsorship policies page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies) on the Pimlico dashboard, clicking on the existing policy and clicking on the "Edit button".

Request is sent with POST, where body is a JSON object with the following structure:

```typescript
const body = {
    type: 'sponsorshipPolicy.webhook',
    data: {
        object: {
            userOperation,
            entryPoint,
            chainId,
            sponsorshipPolicyId: sponsorshipPolicy.id    
        }
    }
};
```

The returned value should be a JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
    "sponsor": true // Boolean
}
```
